Q.6 What are some of the advantages of HsTML5 over its previous versions?

Ans : These are the major advantages of HTML5 over its previous versions,
        1. It has improved accessibility of websites to a greate extent. As tags like <section>, <article>, <header>, <footer> are easy  to read and understand by screen readers.
        
        2. In previous versions using audio,video elements meant using third party media players. But in HTML5 it introduced <audio> and <video> elements which allows to add multi-media without any glitch.
        
        3. It also introduced local storage which is again a game changer and cookies are no longer needed.

        4. HTML5 also supports custome data attributes, which was risky before.

        5. It also adds autofocus to form fields and script and link tags no longer require type attribute.
