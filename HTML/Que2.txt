Q.2 Explain Semantic tags in html? And why do we need it?

Ans : Explaination :-
      ------------
    The semantic tags helps the search engine and other user devices to determine the importance of webpage content.
    It has great importance in terms of accessibility.
    Pages developed with semantic tags are much easier to read.

    Reason :-
    ------
    Before semantics came we used to use elements like `<div></div>` and give them class or id of specific working.
    Like <div class="header"> Header </div>.
    So tag dosen't describe its functionalities at first look or from its name.
    It may create confusion to find out specific code block and becomes a hectic task.
    So, we need semantics to gain effective code, greater accessibility and great user experience.
